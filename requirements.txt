# Python dependencies for Vercel serverless functions
# These are required for the /api/generate endpoint

# Note: Vercel Python runtime includes some packages by default
# Only list what's needed for the trigram model and tokenizer

# No additional packages needed!
# The project uses only Python stdlib:
# - pickle (stdlib)
# - json (stdlib) 
# - random (stdlib)
# - collections (stdlib)
# - typing (stdlib)

# If you add external dependencies later, list them here
# Example:
# numpy==1.24.0
# fastapi==0.109.0
